# D2R-Clone-Helper

Detect connections with remote addresses opened by D2R process.

Features:

- Overview past and present opened connections (that were detected while this app was running)
- Block/Unblocking remote addresses on Firewall, blocking also closes existing connection (mint not work yet as I am having hard time testing this due to Antivirus software managing my Firewall. Rules are getting created, only Antivirus Firewall is ignoring them)
- Write notes next to each IP address
- Add manually your own IP addresses

It is kinda spagetty code so there might be some bugs. I will squash them when I get some sleep.
