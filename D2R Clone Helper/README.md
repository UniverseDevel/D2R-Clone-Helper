# D2R-Clone-Helper

Detect connections with remote addresses opened by D2R process. Win10+ only.

Features:

- Overview past and present opened connections (that were detected while this app was running)
- Block/Unblocking remote addresses on Firewall, blocking also closes existing connection which should prevent the need for client restart
  - might not work fully yet, as I am having hard time testing this due to Antivirus software managing my Firewall. Rules are getting created, only Antivirus Firewall is ignoring them
- Write notes next to each IP address
- Add manually your own IP addresses

Precompiled binary can be found here: https://github.com/UniverseDevel/D2R-Clone-Helper/blob/master/D2R%20Clone%20Helper/bin/Release/D2R%20Clone%20Helper.exe

It is kinda spaghetti code so there might be some bugs. I will squash them when I get some sleep and find some more time.
